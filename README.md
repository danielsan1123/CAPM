This is a guide project on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) from Coursera. CAPM is an important theory that assists investors in estimating returns based on risk (rm-rf) and the overall market (rm), typically represented by the US 10-year government bond as risk-free (rf). CAPM is determined by the expected return and the product's beta (covariance rate) of an expected return.

The equation can be understood simply as :
ri ~ rf + B(rm-rf)

This analysis displays a simple approach to calculating ri and visualizing data for mathematical decision for investment.
